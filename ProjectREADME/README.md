2. App concept: Halloween Pick is an app made to make family (or friend or date!) nights easier to plan and therefor enjoy. The app picks three major picks for your night: your cocktail, your snacks, and your movie. This way you spend less time discussing what everyone wants, and more time enjoying each other's company.    


3. Technologies used
    React
    CSS


4. Approach Taken
    This is a full CRUD application, with Search capabilities using a third party movie API. 
    We created a base with a Home component. This provides the users a randomized selection of Movie, Drink, and Treat. 
    The Movie choices on the Home page are pulled from our own Movie MongoDB data. All Drink and Treat choices are from our two additional MongoDB sets.
    All data is fed into the additional components - MovieIndex, SearchMovies, TreatsIndex, Show, and ShowMovie.
