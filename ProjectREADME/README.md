2. App concept: Halloween Pick is an app made to make family (or friends or dates!) nights in easier to plan and therefor enjoy. The app picks three major picks for your night: your cocktail, your snacks, and your movie. This way you spend less time discussing what everyone wants, and more time enjoying each other's company.

7. Unsolved problems

Unsolved problems include the following:
    -Mainly styling. All routes run correctly

Areas I struggled and need more practice:
    -Using two sets of data
    -Using correct paths within my files to create the routes
    -Typos, simple syntax errors
